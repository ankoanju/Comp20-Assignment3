		Short for student tours, stour! is a day-in-a-life campus tour business run by students. Usually, campus tours are organised by the University and volunteers show the visitors around specific historical or main buildings of the college campus. Most of them consist of simply walking around and examining the library. At stour! students plan their own tours for prospective students and their family members to actually experience what a typical day is like at their university. We hope stour! can expand the opportunities and allow students to experience the real routine.

		stour! organisers look through the plan to check the validity of the tour. We will then categorize according to the overall theme of the tour. Some categories we have include: general, sports, engineering, daily life activities, and music. </div>

	Finally, we post the stour! student-planned campus tours on our website for anyone to sign up. Participant numbers range from 1 to 10 depending on the activity. We hope the small number interaction between students will enhance a tighter bond even after the tour. </div>
